            The seemingly unimpressive Saitama has a rather unique hobby: being
            a hero. In order to pursue his childhood dream, Saitama relentlessly
            trained for three years, losing all of his hair in the process. Now,
            Saitama is so powerful, he can defeat any enemy with just one punch.
            However, having no one capable of matching his strength has led
            Saitama to an unexpected problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the
            thrill of battling and has become quite bored.

            After being aggressively rejected, Momo Ayase finds herself sulking
            when she stumbles across a boy being bullied. Saved by her rash
            kindness, the occult-obsessed boy attempts to speak to her about
            supernatural interests he believes they share. Rejecting his claims,
            Ayase proclaimed that she is instead a believer in ghosts, starting
            an argument between the two over which is real.
